=head1 USAGE

  npg_samplesheet_generator_NovaSeqXSeries [options]

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head1 OPTIONS

  C<help>     - displays help message and exists

  
  C<batch_id> - LIMS batch identifier, optional

  C<id_run>   - NPG run ID, optional; if supplied, the record for this run
                should exists in the run tracking database

  C<read_length> -
                an optional list of read lengths, forward first, reverse
                second; currently both default to 151

  C<index_read_length> -
                an optional list of index read lengths for the first and,
                optionally, second index read; if not given, computed from
                the length of barcodes recorded in LIMS

  C<align>    - a boolean option, false by default; if set, the DRAGEN
                germline analysis section is added to the file if suitable
                samples are present

  C<varcall>  - variant calling mode, defaults to C<None>, other valid options
                C<SmallVariantCaller> and C<AllVariantCallers>

  C<keep_fastq> -
                an option to keep FASTQ files for aligned data, false by
                default

  C<dragen_max_number_of_configs> -
                DRAGEN analysis can deal with a limited number of distinct
                configurations. Set this attribute if processing off-board.
